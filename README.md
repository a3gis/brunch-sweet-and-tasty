# Brunch Sweet and Tasty

Good fancy brunch with [Livescript](http://gkz.github.com/LiveScript/), [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org), [Sugar](http://sugarjs.com/) and [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) :)

## Getting started

Make sure to have [Brunch.io](http://brunch.io) installed.

Create your project with:

		brunch new <your-project-name> -s github://a3gis/brunch-sweet-and-tasty
		
Or simply copy the repository on your hard drive and rename it.

## Customize Bootstrap Stylesheets

All Bootstrap stylesheet files can be found separated into:

		vendor/styles/bootstrap
		
They're in original [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) format in order to be easily customized, and compiled together with the app build.
